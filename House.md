* 2020-04-25: Eli completed the 2020-04-22 homework.
              Then we got the ball rotating in place.

              Assigned today: Eli will make the ball travel around and
              bounce off the sides of the window while rotating.

* 2020-04-22: Eli to learn the meaning of everything in the 1st example
              on https://www.pygame.org/docs/tut/PygameIntro.html and be
              able to explain it.  If have extra time, make eliGame.py
              do more (like move the circle, or expand it, etc).
