* 2020-05-17: Homework assigned today:

  - Write doc strings for all functions and methods.

  - Separate moving from bouncing -- that is, separate moving from
    *both* wall-bouncing and from ball-bouncing.

  - Finish debugging & fixing the ball-overlap bug.

  - BONUS: Make it more efficient -- don't check every pair of balls twice

* 2020-05-14: Homework assigned today:

  - Spawning code should be aware of where other balls are being
    spawned and avoid collisions.

  - Fix the bounce bug that shows up frequently with 5 balls
    (and also shows up with lower numbers of balls, though
    less frequently).

  - Karl to explain to Eli commands need "./" on the front
    (next time, because)

* 2020-05-10: Homework assigned today:

  - Make the balls bounce off each other.

  - Maybe do fancy wall-bounce behavior too, if time.

  - Maybe read a number higher than 9, if time.

* 2020-05-04: Homework assigned today:

              - Make the number of balls be an argument to the program.

              - Just do simple bouncing, not fancy bouncing.

              - Make screen Surface size be dynamic, based on real screen size.

              - Allow user to quit by typing 'q'.

* 2020-04-25: Eli completed the 2020-04-22 homework.
              Then we got the ball rotating in place.

              Assigned today: Eli will make the ball travel around and
              bounce off the sides of the window while rotating.

* 2020-04-22: Eli to learn the meaning of everything in the 1st example
              on https://www.pygame.org/docs/tut/PygameIntro.html and be
              able to explain it.  If have extra time, make eliGame.py
              do more (like move the circle, or expand it, etc).
