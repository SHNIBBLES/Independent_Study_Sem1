# Semester 1:

## September 6th - October 5th - Programming

* Week 1: 

  Setting up a programming environment.

* Week 2: 

  Working with a programming-oriented text editor and integrated development environment (IDE); using Git version control, collaborating, etc.

* Week 3: 

  Due for week 3: Use turtle to draw basic shapes (with 5 pointed stars)
  Bonus: Figure out how to take user input, take a number from the user, and draw something based on that number.

  Make emacs do tab ind. in python
  Basic graphics programming.
  Using the basic Python 'turtle' graphics - navigating the Python online documentation.

* Week 4:

  Homework for next time: Include how the program should behave, Finish Word Checker Program, and make it work for multiple files at the same time.
  Showing Data, Debugging.

## November 12th - December 21th - Programming

* Week 5:

  Representing data visually: charts, graphs, etc.
  Approaches to debugging; how to decide where to ask your program questions, and what questions to ask it.

* Week 6:

  Due this week:
  Do word_checker but with files from computer

  Accessing the operating system.
  Reading/writing files and folders.
  Exercise: write a basic duplicates finder.
  
* Week 7:

  Thinking algorithmically.
  What can we speed up in the basic duplicates finder?
  Using Dictionaries (hash tables).
  Exercise: improve the duplicates finder.

* Week 8:

  Classes, objects and methods.
  How to organize code for maintainability.

* Week 9:

  How to bring third-party non-core open source libraries into an application.
  (Further improvements to duplicates finder.)

# Semester 2:

  libraries into an application.

  (Further improvements to duplicates finder.)

* Weeks 10: Basic system administration.

  Setting up a cloud server from scratch.
  Understanding how servers work.

* Weeks 11, 12: Putting it online.

  Making a web server respond programmatically 
  to a browser.  Basic database usage.

* Weeks 13: Packaging and maintaining software.

  Writing a README, installation documentation, 
  applying an open source license, verifying
  that a third party can actually deploy, having
  a process for reviewing incoming changes, etc.

* Week 14: Serious string formatting.

  All the ways to embed dynamic data into strings.

  Exercise: Align output from the duplicates finder.

* Weeks 15, 16, 17:  Final Project (Programming)

Final Project: Machine Learning Surveillance Project with cats, Luigi
and Mario.  The final project is programming an automated system for
distinguishing between my two similar-looking cats and logging when
they drink from the cat fountain based on the time since it has been
cleaned, the time of day, or other factors.

The final project reflects the objectives of the course in that it
uses all of the programming techniques and collaboration techniques
taught in the course to build an open-source program that performs a
“machine learning” task and that can be shared with others who wish to
use it to perform similar tasks.

The project will be shared with the greater Parker community as open
source software but also by way of an MX presentation at the end of
the year.
